1) Tell About Yourself? 
 "First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is Venkatasai. I completed my graduation in 2023 from Sri Indu Institute of Engineering and Technology, with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

During my final year, I completed an internship where I worked on two major projects:

Hostel Management Application – A web-based platform for managing hostel rooms and assignments efficiently.

Builders Management Application – A comprehensive system for managing employee records, attendance, and salary tracking in the construction domain.

These projects helped me strengthen my skills in full-stack development, problem-solving, and real-world application of technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

My strengths include:

Quick adaptability to new environments

Strong communication and problem-solving skills

A continuous eagerness to learn and explore new technologies

I’m excited about opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and bring value to the team. Once again, thank you for this opportunity.

2) why do you want to work for our company?

"As a fresher, I’m looking for a company where I can learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully.

I’m really impressed by your company’s work in software development, especially how you use modern technologies

like React and Node.js — which I’ve also used in my projects. I believe this is a great place to start my career,

and I’m excited about the chance to learn from your experienced team and be part of innovative projects."

3)why should we hire you?

"You should hire me because I’m a quick learner, hardworking, and always eager to grow. Even though I’m a fresher,

I’ve built real-time projects like a hostel management system and a builders management application,

which helped me gain practical experience in full-stack development.

I’m confident in my ability to adapt to your work environment, contribute to your team, and continuously improve. 

I’m not just looking for a job — I’m looking for a place to grow, and I believe your company is the right place for that."**

4)where do you see your self in 5 years?

"In 5 years, I see myself as a skilled and experienced software developer, working on challenging and impactful projects. 

I want to grow both technically and professionally, possibly take on leadership responsibilities,

and become someone who can help and guide others in the team.

Right now, my focus is on learning as much as I can, improving every day, and contributing to the success of the company that gives me the opportunity."**

5) what is your strengths and weakneses?
"My strengths are adaptability, teamwork, and quick learning. I can adjust quickly to new environments,
whether it's a new team or a new project, and I stay calm and productive during changes. 
I'm also a strong team player—I enjoy collaborating with others and ensuring we meet our goals together.
For example, in my last project, I worked closely with my team to share tasks and deliver results on time. 
Another key strength is that I’m a quick learner. I was able to learn technologies like React, Node.js, and SQL in a short time and used them effectively in my project work."
?? learn from other mistakes.

"One of my weaknesses is that I’m a very straightforward person. Sometimes, I say things directly, which may sound a bit blunt. 
But I’m learning to share my thoughts in a more polite and professional way."
"Also, when I focus on a problem, I get deeply involved and keep trying until I get the solution. But sometimes 
I forget to step back and think of other ways. 
Now, I try to be more active in discussing with my team and look at the problem from different sides."
